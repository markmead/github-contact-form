# GitHub Contact Form

Add a contact form to your website that creates a GitHub issue when submitted.

**Perfect for developer websites**

## Usage

### Installation

You need to install Octokit in your project. This is not handled by the package
as Octokit is quite large and I didn't want to assume you aren't already using
it.

```shell
yarn add -D octokit gh-contact-form
npm install -D octokit gh-contact-form
```

```js
import { Octokit } from 'octokit'
import GhContactForm from 'gh-contact-form'
```

### Example

When initialising `GhContactForm` you need to pass the instance of Octokit.

```js
const contactForm = new GhContactForm(
  new Octokit({
    auth: '<GitHub Personal Access Token>',
  })
)
```

When submitting a form you'll want to use `async/await` so you can check the
response from the GitHub API.

**It's NOT required to use `async/await` for the package to work**

```js
async function createGitHubIssue() {
  const response = await contactForm.sendMessage({
    owner: '<GitHub Username>', // Required
    repo: '<GitHub Repository>', // Required
    title: 'Website Request', // Required
    body: 'I would like a new website.',
  })
}
```

_The `createGitHubIssue` is for the example, it's not included in the package._

You can pass what you like to `title` and `body`. One thing that I do is create
the `body` from multiple bits of data.

```js
const typeValue = document.getElementById('typeField').value
const emailValue = document.getElementById('emailField').value

const issueBody = `Email: ${email}\nType: ${type}\n${body}`

function createGitHubIssue() {
  contactForm.sendMessage({
    // ...
    body: issueBody,
  })
}
```

Once submitted this will create a new GitHub issue in the GitHub repository
passed as `repo`.

## Spam Prevention

If you want to prevent spam (recommended) then you can so like this.

```html
<input type="hidden" id="spamField" />
```

```js
async function createGitHubIssue() {
  const spamValue = document.getElementById('spamField').value

  const response = await contactForm.sendMessage({
    // ...
    spam: spamValue,
  })
}
```

If `spam` is detected a GitHub issue will not be created.

## Private Issues

If the GitHub repository is private then you're fine.

However, if the repository is public and you want private issues (recommended)
then the best approach is to create a new repository that is private and send
the issues to there.
